So far, this userscript / extension was tested on Google Chrome 12 and Firefox 5 with [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) ([download](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/748/)) and should also work in Safari with the plugin [NinjaKit](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/os0x/20100612/1276330696) ([download](http://ss-o.net/safari/extension/NinjaKit.safariextz)).

Feedback is welcome.
